-- Create a new table named `Bike_Share_Data_2023` in the `Cyclistic_Bike_Share` dataset if it doesn't exist, by combining data from various monthly tables from December 2022 to November 2023. 
Each monthly table represents bike share data for a specific month and year. The `UNION ALL` operator is used to concatenate the data from each monthly table into the new table without removing duplicate rows.
